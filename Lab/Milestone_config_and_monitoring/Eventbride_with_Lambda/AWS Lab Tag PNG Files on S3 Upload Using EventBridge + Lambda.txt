ðŸ“Œ Objective
	Whenever a PNG file is uploaded to Amazon S3, an Amazon EventBridge rule triggers a Lambda function that automatically adds a tag Watermarked=ATS to the object.
	
ðŸš€ Steps
1. Create an S3 Bucket

	Open S3 Console â†’ Create bucket.
	Enter a unique name, e.g., eventbridge-watermark-lab.
	Leave default settings (keep block public access ON).
	Click Create bucket.
	
2. Create a Lambda Function

	Go to Lambda Console â†’ Create function.
	Choose:
		Author from scratch
		Function name: S3TagWatermark
		Runtime: Python 3.9 (or latest available).
	Click Create function.
	Replace the default code with: LamdaCode.py
	
	Click Deploy.
	Update Lambda permissions:
		Go to Configuration â†’ Permissions â†’ Execution role â†’ IAM console.
		Attach policy: AmazonS3FullAccess (or create a custom policy with s3:PutObjectTagging).		
	
3. Create an EventBridge Rule
	Go to EventBridge Console â†’ Rules â†’ Create rule.
	Name: S3PNGUploadRule.
	Event source: AWS events or EventBridge partner events.
	Use this event pattern (replace bucket name if different):				
		{
		  "source": ["aws.s3"],
		  "detail-type": ["Object Created"],
		  "detail": {
			"bucket": {
			  "name": ["eventbridge-watermark-lab"]
			}
		  }
		}	
	For Target, choose Lambda function â†’ S3TagWatermark.
		Click Create rule.
	
4. Test the Setup

	Upload a PNG file into your S3 bucket.
	Open CloudWatch Logs â†’ Log groups â†’ /aws/lambda/S3TagWatermark â†’ check the latest log stream.
	You should see the event details printed.
	Response should include "status": "tagged".
	In the S3 Console:
		Open your uploaded PNG â†’ go to Properties â†’ Tags.
		You should see: Watermarked=ATS.
	
5. Monitor with CloudWatch Metrics (Optional)
	Go to CloudWatch â†’ Metrics â†’ Events â†’ By Rule Name.
	Select S3PNGUploadRule.
	Check metrics like:
	InvocationAttempts
	SuccessfulInvocationAttempts
	
ðŸ§¹ Cleanup (Avoid Charges)
	Delete EventBridge Rule
		Go to EventBridge â†’ Rules â†’ Delete S3PNGUploadRule.
	Delete Lambda Function
		Go to Lambda â†’ Delete S3TagWatermark.
	Delete S3 Bucket
		Empty the bucket â†’ Delete it.
	Delete CloudWatch Logs
		Go to CloudWatch â†’ Log groups â†’ Delete /aws/lambda/S3TagWatermark.
