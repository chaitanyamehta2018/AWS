RDS Super Lab – Detailed Manual Steps
=====================================
Mission
	Explore Amazon RDS features for:
	High Availability (Multi-AZ)
	Scalability (Read Replicas)
	Disaster Recovery (Replica promotion)
	
Additonal files for this lab:
	../php_content_without_read_replica/dbtest.php
	../php_content_without_read_replica/index.php
	../php_content_with_read_replica/dbtest.php
	../php_content_with_read_replica/index.php

Step 1: Configure a Multi-AZ Deployment

	Go to AWS RDS Console → Create database.
	Method: Standard create.
	Engine: MySQL.
	Template: Production.
	Availability & durability: Multi-AZ DB instance.
	DB identifier: MyDB.
	Master username: admin.
	Master password: Indian123.
	Instance class: db.t3.micro.
	Storage:
	General Purpose SSD (gp3)
	Allocated: 20 GB
	Disable autoscaling.
	Click Create database.

Step 2: Create EC2 Instance (Web Server)

	Go to EC2 Console → Launch instance.
	Name: Web-Server.
	AMI: Amazon Linux 2023.
	Type: t2.micro.
	Key pair: new or existing.
	Security group:
	Allow SSH (22) from 0.0.0.0/0.
	Allow HTTP (80) from Internet.
	Launch the instance.

Step 3: Connect RDS from EC2
	SSH into EC2:
	sudo -i
	Install MySQL client:
	sudo dnf update -y
	sudo dnf install mariadb105
	Get RDS endpoint from RDS Console → Connectivity & security.

	Connect:
	mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u admin -p
	Password: Indian123
	
Step 4: Create Database & Table
	In MySQL:
	CREATE DATABASE myDatabase;
	USE myDatabase;
	CREATE TABLE guestbook (
		id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
		name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
		message TEXT NOT NULL
	);
	CREATE USER 'dbadmin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Indian@123';
	GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, REFERENCES,
	INDEX, EXECUTE, TRIGGER ON myDatabase.* TO 'dbadmin'@'%';


	Exit MySQL: exit; .

Step 5: Configure EC2 as PHP Web Server
	Install PHP:

	sudo dnf install php8.1
	sudo dnf install php8.1-mysqlnd.x86_64
	Start PHP-FPM:
		systemctl start php-fpm
		systemctl enable php-fpm
		systemctl status php-fpm
	Start Apache:
		systemctl start httpd
		systemctl enable httpd
		systemctl status httpd

Step 6: Configure & Access Web Page
	Go to web root:
		cd /var/www/html

	Create dbtest.php:
		<?php
		$servername = "<RDS End Point>";
		$username = "dbadmin";
		$password = "Indian@123";
		$database = "myDatabase";
		$pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=$servername;dbname=$database", $username, $password);
		$pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
		?>

	Create index.php with insert & search form (guestbook).

	Open in browser:
		http://<EC2 Public IP>
		→ Add/Search records .

Step 7: Test Multi-AZ Failover
	
	First read the database from the EC2 command line:
	
	mysql -h <rds-endpoint> -u admin -p
	USE myDatabase;
	SELECT * FROM guestbook;
	
		It should display like following.
		MySQL [myDatabase]> SELECT * FROM guestbook;
			+----+---------+------------------+
			| id | name    | message          |
			+----+---------+------------------+
			|  1 | Harilal | Kem chho Harilal |
			|  2 | Ramlal  | Kem chho Ramlal  |
			+----+---------+------------------+
			2 rows in set (0.001 sec)

	Now check the High availability.
	In RDS Console → Select DB → Actions → Reboot with failover.
	Keep adding records on webpage during failover → confirm HA (no disruption).

Step 8: Create a Read Replica
	In RDS Console → Select DB → Actions → Create read replica.
	Settings:
	Identifier: mydb-read-replica
	Class: db.t3.micro
	Storage: gp3, 20 GB
	Availability: Single instance
	Launch

Step 9: Update Application for Read Queries
	On EC2, go to:
	cd /var/www/html
	Replace index.php with new version that:
	Uses $pdoWrite for writes (primary DB).
	Uses $pdoRead for reads (replica).

Step 10: Verify Read Replicas
	Open webpage.
	Add/Search records repeatedly.
	In RDS Console → Replica → Monitoring, check:
	Replica lag
	ReadIOPS.

Step 11: Manual Failover of Read Replica
	Delete Primary DB instance:
	Disable deletion protection if enabled.
	Delete instance.
	Promote replica:
	Select read replica.
	Stop replication (if needed).
	Actions → Promote.
	Set backup retention, define backup window.
	Promote and wait.

	Update app connection string to new primary endpoint.
	
Step 12: Clean up
	When the lab is complete, remove all resources to avoid unwanted AWS charges:
	Delete Read Replica (if still running):
		Go to RDS Console → Databases.
		Select the read replica (e.g., mydb-read-replica).
		Actions → Delete → Confirm (choose “Skip final snapshot” to avoid storage costs).
	Delete Primary Multi-AZ DB instance:
		Select the primary DB (e.g., MyDB).
		Ensure deletion protection is disabled:
		Actions → Modify → Uncheck Deletion protection → Apply immediately.
		Actions → Delete → Confirm (skip final snapshot unless you need a backup).
	Terminate EC2 Web Server:
		Go to EC2 Console → Instances.
		Select Web-Server instance.
		Actions → Terminate → Confirm.
	Remove associated Security Groups (optional but recommended):
		Delete the EC2-SG-Web and RDS-SG security groups created for the lab (if not used elsewhere).
	Double-check:
		In EC2 Console, confirm no running instances.
		In RDS Console, confirm no DB instances.
		In VPC Console, confirm no unused security groups remain.

✅ At this point, all resources are cleaned up.
