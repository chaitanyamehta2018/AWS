Step-by-Step Instructions
‚úÖ Step 1: Create Security Groups
	1.1 VmSG (for all EC2)
	Inbound: Allow All traffic (0.0.0.0/0) ‚Äì for lab

	Outbound: All allowed (default)

	1.2 FSxSG (for FSx)
	Inbound: Allow All traffic from VmSG

	Outbound: All allowed

‚úÖ Step 2: Launch EC2 Windows Instances
	Repeat the below for each instance: AD-Server, Server-1, and Server-2

	For Each Instance:
	AMI: Windows Server 2019 Base

	Instance Type: t3.medium

	Subnet:

	AD-Server: ap-south-1a

	Server-1: ap-south-1a

	Server-2: ap-south-1b

	Security Group: VmSG

	Key Pair: Choose or create one (needed for RDP)

	Launch instance 

‚úÖ Step 3: Change Administrator Password to Matrix@123
		Immediately after launching, for each instance:

		On your local system:
		RDP into each EC2 instance using the key pair

		Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator

		Run the following command:

		powershell
		Copy
		Edit
		net user Administrator Matrix@123
		üí° Optional: You can disable password complexity temporarily using:

		powershell
		Copy
		Edit
		secedit /export /cfg C:\secpol.cfg
		(notepad C:\secpol.cfg)  # Edit line: PasswordComplexity = 0
		secedit /configure /db %windir%\security\local.sdb /cfg C:\secpol.cfg /areas SECURITYPOLICY
		

‚úÖ Step 4: Configure Active Directory
On AD-Server:

		Part 1: Add Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
		This installs the role but does not promote the server yet.

		‚úÖ Steps in Server Manager:
		Open Server Manager (default after login on Windows Server)

		Click "Manage" ‚Üí "Add Roles and Features"

		Wizard starts ‚Üí Click Next on:

		"Before You Begin"

		"Installation Type" ‚Üí Keep default: Role-based or feature-based

		"Server Selection" ‚Üí Keep default (local server)

		On "Server Roles" page:

		Scroll down and check ‚úÖ Active Directory Domain Services

		Click "Add Features" when prompted

		Click Next

		Click Next through Features and AD DS

		On Confirmation page:

		Click Install

		Wait for installation to finish (no reboot required at this point)

		üß© Part 2: Promote Server to Domain Controller
		This is where you create the domain: corp.example.com

		‚úÖ Steps to Promote:
		After installation, you‚Äôll see a yellow triangle warning in Server Manager (top-right).

		Click "Promote this server to a domain controller"

		Deployment Configuration:

		Select: Add a new forest

		Root domain name: corp.example.com

		Click Next

		Domain Controller Options:

		Keep default: ‚úÖ DNS server, ‚úÖ Global Catalog

		Enter DSRM password (e.g. Matrix@123)

		Click Next

		DNS Options:

		It may show a warning about delegation ‚Äî ignore and click Next

		Additional Options:

		NetBIOS name will auto-fill as CORP

		Click Next

		Paths: Keep default (for database, logs, SYSVOL) ‚Üí Click Next

		Review Options: Confirm everything is correct

		Prerequisite Check: Wait for it to complete

		Click Install

		The server will automatically reboot after install

‚úÖ Step 5: Join Server-1 & Server-2 to Domain
	On each server:

	Set Preferred DNS to the private IP of AD-Server

	Join domain: corp.example.com

	Use domain admin credentials

	Reboot

				Step-by-Step: Join Server-1 / Server-2 to Domain
				üîß 1. Open System Properties
				Press Windows + R ‚Üí Type: sysdm.cpl ‚Üí Hit Enter

				This opens System Properties

				üè∑Ô∏è 2. Change Computer Name (optional)
				Click Change...

				If you want, rename the computer (e.g. Server-1)

				Select: ‚úÖ Domain

				Enter domain name:

				Copy
				Edit
				corp.example.com
				üîë 3. Enter Domain Admin Credentials
				When prompted, enter:

				Field	Value
				Username	Administrator
				Password	Matrix@123

‚úÖ Step 6: Create Amazon FSx (Windows File Server)
	Go to Amazon FSx ‚Üí Create File System

	Choose: Windows File Server

	VPC: Default VPC

	Subnets: Use 2 from ap-south-1a and ap-south-1b

	AD Domain: corp.example.com

	Credentials: AD domain admin (created on AD-Server)

	Security Group: FSxSG

	Launch
	It will take almost 15 minutes to get created.

‚úÖ Step 7: Map FSx Share
	On Server-1 & Server-2: Enter the follwing command from cmd prompt.
	net use Z: \\<fsx-dns>\share /user:corp\Administrator Matrix@123 (Latest you will get when you click on the "Attach" option at File system on aws console).
	


‚úÖ To verify from the AD-Server whether Server-1 and Server-2 have successfully joined the domain corp.example.com, you can do this using the Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) console or PowerShell.
		Using GUI (ADUC)
		On the AD-Server,

		Start ‚Üí Server Manager ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Active Directory Users and Computers
		In the left pane, expand:corp.example.com ‚Üí Computers
		You should see Server-1, Server-2 and Amazon FSx listed as objects (computer accounts).

		üß† If you renamed them before joining, they‚Äôll appear by that name.




‚úÖ Lab Setup Complete!
	You now have:
		- Windows EC2s with known passwords
		- Working AD domain
		- FSx joined to AD
